Step-by-Step Guide
Navigate to Swagger UI:

Open your browser and go to the Logusus Swagger UI (usually something like http://<target-ip>/swagger).
Swagger UI is a tool that provides a visual interface for interacting with the API.
Explore HTTP Requests:

In the Swagger UI, you will see a list of available HTTP requests (endpoints) that you can interact with.
Look through the GET API requests to find one that can give you user credentials.
Run Burp Suite:

Open Burp Suite on your machine.
In Burp Suite, go to the "Proxy" tab and ensure the intercept is on.
Run the Browser with Burp Suite:

Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy (usually by setting the proxy settings to 127.0.0.1:8080).
Open the browser and navigate to the Logusus login page.
Log In:

Log in to the application using your credentials.
Burp Suite will capture all the HTTP requests your browser sends.
Create a File to Upload:

Create a simple text file on your machine. You can name it avatar.txt and put some dummy text in it.
Find the PATCH /change-avatar API:

In Swagger UI, look for the PATCH endpoint that allows you to upload an avatar.
This endpoint is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
Prepare to Upload Your File:

In Swagger UI, find the token required for authentication (usually displayed in the top right corner next to the logout button).
Copy this token.
Upload Your File via the PATCH API:

In the PATCH /change-avatar API, paste your token into the required field.
Select your avatar.txt file to upload.
Send the Request:

Execute the API request to upload the file.
Burp Suite will capture this request.
Manipulate the Request in Burp Suite:

In Burp Suite, go to the "Proxy" tab and find the request that contains your file upload (it should be the last one).
Right-click on this request and send it to the "Repeater" tab.
Modify the Request:

In the Repeater tab, find the part of the request where your file is being uploaded.
Change the file path to /root/proof.txt (this is where the flag is located).
Send the Modified Request:



The flag might be encoded, so you may need to decode it using a tool like CyberChef or any other decoding tool.
